1.0.0.4     2024/03/30      Removed templated column in Parts grid because it made editing
                            more difficult. Unfortunately(?) this means the dropdown list of
                            part names will not be available. I don't think it adds much
                            though anyway.
                            Added a new Help menu item to open a known parts list window
                            as a substitute for the lost dropdown list mentioned above.
                            Fixed more regex problems that caused some files not to load.
1.0.0.3     2024/03/28      Fixed a problem that caused some valid HDL files not to load.
1.0.0.2     2024/03/27      First public release at github.com.
